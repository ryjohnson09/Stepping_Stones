This page will discuss how to create a new directory and virtual environment, and deploying a dash application using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

# Create a new directory and initialize a virtual environment:

``` bash
# Create a new blank directory call 'dash-dir'
mkdir dash-dir

# Navigate into the dash-dir directory
cd dash-dir

# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```
